# Digits

About
-----
Digits is a simple GUI finger client for Windows. I tend to keep a C++Builder install 
around but never actually use it, so I built this.

* Has a textbox to specify the username
* Has a textbox to specify the hostname

* Has a multi-line textbox to display the results
* Freezes while making the query like any good 90s GUI application, even if it was built in 2024
